# [NodeSchool Montreal](http://nodeschool.io/montreal/)

**NodeSchool** is open source workshops that teach web software skills. Individuals are encouraged to do the [workshoppers](http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers) on their own or in person at a NodeSchool event. The workshopper tutorials are used as the course curriculum while mentors help attendees work through challenges.
